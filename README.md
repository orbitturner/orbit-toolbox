> 🚨 **Note:** 🚨 An ***ENCODER IS NOT AN ENCRYPTOR***. Encoding is just a transformation from one data representation to another, keeping the same information. Encoding ensures interoperability between systems. It allows systems that use different data representations to share information.</br>  Encoding has no security purpose. Anyone who knows the conversion algorithm can encode and decode data. The conversion algorithm is not kept secret. On the contrary, it is public in order to facilitate interoperability between systems. Finally, encoding is a reversible process. You can transform a piece of data from one representation to another and then go back to the original representation without information loss.. </br> Otherwise Encryption is a technique that makes your data unreadable and hard to decode for an unauthorized user. Like pure encoding, encryption is a reversible process as well, although just for authorized people. Authorized people are the ones in possession of a decryption key.
