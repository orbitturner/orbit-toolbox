## Templates

### Tutorial template
Tutorials guide the reader through an entire workflow to complete a task.

You should consider creating a tutorial when:

- The user has a basic understanding of the product and is interested in extending their use and understanding to solve a specific problem.
- The user is looking for expert advice and a detailed discussion on best practices related their problem.
- The user may have implemented a similar solution in the past using a different product.
- The user wants to validate whether the solution is appropriate for their needs.
